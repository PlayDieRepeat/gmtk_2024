## About Hungry Gods

Can you build a thriving village in the shadow of a hungry God?

'Hungry Gods' is a colony simulation where you must balance the progress and wellbeing of your community while appeasing and defying the gods that surround you, or at least thats what it will be!

This project started as our entry for the 2024 Game Makers Toolkit Jam.  During the jam, a storm blew through the Cascades where we were holed up, knocking out power and internet. In defiance of nature and the gods, we have continued development with the goals of growing our knowledge around the Godot ecosystem, honing our individual crafts and giving back to the community at large.

### Open Development

As a part of our desire to learn, grow, and give back, we are committing to an open development philosophy for Hungry Gods. Anyone who wants it will have access to every bit of code, documentation, and planning that we can find a way to share throughout development.

### About the Team
